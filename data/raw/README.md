# Raw Data

This folder represents the raw input data layer of the project.

The original dataset was an Online Retail transactional dataset provided in Excel format (~600k rows).
It contains order-level and item-level transactional records across multiple countries.

The raw data file is not included in this repository to keep it lightweight and to respect data usage constraints.

The raw dataset is assumed to be immutable and was used as the input for the Python data processing pipeline.
