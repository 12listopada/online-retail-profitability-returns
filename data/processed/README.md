# Processed Data

This folder represents the processed data layer generated by the Python pipeline.

During the project, Python (pandas) was used to clean, transform, and enrich the raw data into analytical datasets, including:
- orders-level data
- order-item (line-level) data
- profitability and return-related fields

Intermediate CSV files were generated during development to validate transformations step by step.
These files are not included in the repository, as the final analytical dataset is stored in a SQLite database and consumed directly by Power BI.

This folder documents the logical output of the data processing stage.
